This notebook is intended as reference material for a team participating in the
ACM-ICPC World Finals or any regional competition that allows up to 25 pages of
printed reference material. It incorporates code from various sources and is
based on the notebook used by contestants at the University of Toronto from
2013 to 2014.

Because this version of the notebook is intended for redistribution, it
excludes a small amount of proprietary code present in U. of T.'s official team
notebook.

The philosophy used when compiling this notebook was to include material that
will be most useful for experienced contestants, in terms of reducing the
amount of time spent coding and/or debugging. It therefore excludes algorithms
that serious contestants would be able to code quickly and correctly with a
minimum of effort, such as Dijkstra's algorithm. Most of the material in this
notebook is therefore less common, theoretically nontrivial, or tricky to get
right on the first try.

The code added to the algorithms folder may not be clean or useable in a programming contest.
